<!-- jake said not to worry about assignments a lot this week and to try my best in regards to the labs and the checkpoint. He also said to let you know if I feel I will need an extension for the checkpoint over the weekend which I will do if need be. Thank you again to both of you for being so understanding and willing to help me. For sure was an off week for me. -->
