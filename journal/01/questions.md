# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > | Git helps keep projects in order by the version control system especially when working with other developers Branching also is a big bonus when using Git.|

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > | Make directory |

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > | Used in CSS to style elements based on info that isnt directly in the html. It starts with a ":" and common ones I think I will use is :hover and :active.|

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > | It is built into CSS to determine what rule should be applied in case there are multiple rules targeting the same element and property on that element. Whichever comes second will be applied first or whichever one has a higher interval. |

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > | If you keep using the !important it is going to get messy because it messes up specificity and can override other code that you weren't intending which takes up more time for a developer. 

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > | Selector, Property and Value. |

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > | Good design is crucial in grabbing people's attention when they visit a website because it is what they see first. If you have a good design they will most likely stay on the page longer whereas if the design sucks people will just leave. You can convey whatever message your website is portraying which then makes an impact on the viewer. When you have great readability and layout that os also a great way to convey messages. |

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > | Wireframing helps to visualize what a website or an app's layout. This is great because you can present that to a client before actually building the website or app itself.It gives the developer structure as well while building. |

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > | Yes because it is a great way to really understand the project and have a clear idea on what to code. It is also great when working in teams because everyone can visualize what the project end result may look like. It also makes it easier to build the website.|
